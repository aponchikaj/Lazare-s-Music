                Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination
                of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise
                expressive content.
                However, definitions of music vary depending on culture,
                though it is an aspect of all human societies and a
                cultural universal.
                While scholars agree that music is defined by a
                few specific elements, there is no consensus 
                on their precise definitions.The creation of
                music is commonly divided into musical composition, 
                musical improvisation, and musical performance,though 
                the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, 
                criticism, philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts. 
                Music may be performed using a vast range of instruments, 
                including the human voice to sing, and thus is often credited for 
                its extreme versatility and opportunity for creativity.

                In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and responding while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player, and a universal feature of radios and smartphones.
